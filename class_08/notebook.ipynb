    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "A decorator that wraps a regular (non-class) function to add extra behavior, like logging, timing, or access checks, without changing the function’s code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:**  \n",
    "Imagine a “Log In” button on a school website. A function decorator is like adding a security guard who checks if you’re allowed to log in before the button works, without changing the login code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:**  \n",
    "Adding a check to a website function, like ensuring a user is logged in before showing their grades.\n"

    "What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "Definition: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing code that organizes it into objects, which are like real-world things (e.g., a student or a website user). Each object is created from a class (a blueprint) and can have data (attributes, like a student’s name) and actions (methods, like showing a grade). OOP makes code easier to manage, reuse, and scale, especially for building websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogy: Think of OOP as a school with students (objects). The school has a student blueprint (class) that says every student has a name and grade (attributes) and can do things like check grades (methods). OOP organizes the website like a school, with clear rules for students and teachers.\n",
    "Why Use OOP?: It helps create structured, reusable code for web development, like managing user logins or grades on a school website, by grouping related data and actions.\n",
    "In Web Development: OOP is used in the backend (e.g., Python with Flask) to create objects for users, process their data (e.g., grades from a database), and send results to the frontend for display on the client’s device (browser).\n",
    "For Students: “OOP is like organizing a school website so each student has their own profile with their name, grades, and actions like viewing grades.”"
